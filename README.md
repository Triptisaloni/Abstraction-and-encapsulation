# Abstraction-and-encapsulation
17.Abstraction 

The concept of abstraction is that we focus on essential qualities.
Abstraction means, that we can have an idea or a concept that is completely separate from any specific instance.
It is one of the fundamental building blocks of object oriented programming.

For example, when you use cout, you're actually using the cout object of the class iostream.

Cout<<”Hello”<<endl;


18.Encapsulation

In object orientation, encapsulation means more than simply combining attributes and behavior together within a class; it also means restricting access to the inner workings of that class.

In summary the benefits of encapsulation are:
- Control the way data is accessed or modified.
- Code is more flexible and easy to change with new requirements.
- Change one part of code without affecting other part of code.
